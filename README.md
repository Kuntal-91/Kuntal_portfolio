Project 1: Tableau project of HR ANALYTICS BASED on ATTRITION COUNT
> I used a sample Excel sheet from Kaggle and made did data cleaning first
> I went through the data and found out the different attributes that can be taken from the data
> For the BI tool I used Tableau as Tableau is a more efficient tool.
> In sheet 1 I found the KPI in text format which gives us a brief description of the sheet.
> In the 2nd sheet I found out attrition by gender and made a lollipop chart in it.
> In the 3rd sheet I found attrition by department name and I used a pie chart
> In the 4th sheet I found the employees by age group and made a bin where I created a parameter 
so that we can find the age in some ranges like 20-24,24-28 etc.
> In the 5th sheet I tried finding the Job satisfaction rating where I changed the job satisfaction rating 
column from a dimension to a measure and then used a heat map for it.
> Finally i created the dashboard where I included all the worksheets and used education and department as
a filter.
